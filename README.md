Garmin Weather Watch

This is a watchface designed to be fully customizable via layout.xml values. You can move around elements, add and remove elements to the watchface.

All drawables are extensible, which means that you can inherit from any drawable and make a new one which suits your taste.

Location is currentl fetched from the activity, with plans to have it fetched from activity and the phone location, which is usually more accurate.

# Folders
- GarminFW -> The watchface code. Most of the code goes here.
- Google User Script -> The _backend_ of the watchface that fecthes online data.
- Extras -> stuff that is not exactly needed for the watchface.
